# University-Honors-Project

## Introduction

The UCR Honors Program is a program designed to help students network with faculty, staff, and other students and have opportunities for research and internships. These communities of students consist of a variety of majors, admitted cohort years, and other variables. Towards the end of the program students are expected to complete a capstone project. 

The data presented is an aggregate of different factors that UCR committee kept in mind when considering accepting students into their honors program. The types of data include both categorical and numerical, providing a well-rounded image of the type of student that UCR is looking for in a prospective honors student.  

The objective of the study is to create a profile on potentially successful students in order to understand what type of student groups perform the best and to be able to market the program towards those students.
